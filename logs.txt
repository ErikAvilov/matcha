I'm gonna log my mistates, assumptions or whatever whenever I feel like it

- Error : The website didn't reload upon modifications on react's js
- Solution : Wrong port, I had 80 exposed but react by default uses 3000

I don't need nginx

I want to kms wtf is this syntax who coded this?

I'm tired of trying to learn React through tutorials or garbage like that.
The best way to learn is through small steps and objectives. I made a cute navbar in css,
incorporated routes to each buttons and now trying to code the user authentication page.
The subject forbids the usage of ORMs for the backend so it's gotta be nothing like Django.

Why is everything so hard, I hate it, I hate learning, I despise spending my time coding this shit
I don't even know if it's what I'm meant to do, everything becomes distateful now
I'm constantly reminded of how dogshit I am, of how vast the real world is, I don't even have any purpose
so why the fuck have i kept going for all those years, spending nights in that school working alone on group projects
writing resumes and cover letters after cover letters just to get rejected, does having ambitions isn't enough?
Guess i'll keep working, keep getting better, keep standing out from my peers because at the end of the day, no one can be prouder of me than myself

Using any pydantic tools is forbidden by the subject, since pydantic helps with validation there is literally nothing you can use from it
Including BaseModel or other stuff that makes it easier to create users
Instead you just make a class with a bunch of variables in it and voila
From tnard's github I noticed that they in fact import Json from pydantic but it must be an error cuz they're not using it in the file
