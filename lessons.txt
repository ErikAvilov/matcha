You can use ternary conditions in react
exemple:

let bird = 0; <=== change this to impact which image will be displayed

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
		{bird == 0 ? (
			<img src={pigeon} className="App-pigeon" alt="pigeon" />) :
			(<img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />)}
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}

In fastAPI we don't call them "views" but rather "endpoints"

Ok about exported functions I've always been worried that using too much of them could impact performance.
Apparently nope! It's still important to organize your code ofc but in terms of strain on memory, it doesn't harm much.
